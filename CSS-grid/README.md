## What is CSS grid?

CSS grid allows you to control the layout of a web page along the vertical and horizontal axes (two-dimensional layout system). CSS grid allows you to create responsive and complex layouts using rows and columns. With CSS, you can define the sizes and proportions of grid items, control the alignment of items within the grid cells, and make a web page adapt to different screen sizes.

CSS Grid offers a two-dimensional grid-based layout, allowing you to center items horizontally and vertically while still retaining control to do things like overlap elements.

CSS Grid gives you control over the rows and columns of your webpage design.

CSS grid is often paired with Media queries to create super responsive web pages and it is supported in all major web browsers.
