###### Chinua Achebe, during his book review

I was asked to create a tribute page for any subject of my choice, and I immediately thought of the Writer Chinua Achebe whose literary works shaped my childhood.

"People from different parts of the world can respond to the same story
if it says something to them about their own history
and their own experience." ~ Chinua Achebe, 1930-2013.
