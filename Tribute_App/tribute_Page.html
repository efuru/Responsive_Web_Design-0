<h2>Here's a timeline of Chinua Achebe's life:</h2>

<section id="tribute-info">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1930</strong> - Chinua Achebe was born Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe in Ogidi, Colonial Nigeria, 
      present-day Anambra state, Nigeria. 
      He was a novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as a central figure of modern African Literature. 
      Some of his notable works are the African Trilogy which tells the story of the lives of three generations 
      of an African community affected by British colonialism and its aftermaths.</li>
<li><strong>1936</strong> -  Achebe entered St Philips' Central School in the Akpakaogwe region of Ogidi for his primary education.</li>
<li><strong>1929</strong> - Achebe had his secondary education at the prestigious Government College Umuahia 
  in Nigeria's present-day Abia State.</li>
<li><strong>1948</strong> - Chinua Achebe was admitted to Nigeria’s first university, University College (now the University of Ibadan), 
  with a bursary to study medicine. However, Chinua Achebe became critical of Western literature about Africa. 
  He decided to become a writer after reading Mister Johnson by Joyce Cary, a book that portrayed Nigerian characters as savages or buffoons. 
  Achebe saw this as a sign of the author’s cultural ignorance. He switched his studies to English, history, and theology, 
  losing his scholarship and requiring extra tuition fees. 
  The government provided a bursary and his family donated money to help him continue his studies.</li>
<li><strong>1958</strong> - His first novel and magnum opus, “Things Fall Apart”, was published. 
  "Things Fall Apart,” tells the story of Okonkwo’s downfall due to fate and personal flaws, 
  and the destruction of his culture and society as they face unfamiliar and overwhelming forces. 
  “Things Fall Apart” will go on to be the first in a 3 series that shaped modern-day African literature.</li>
<li><strong>1960</strong> - Achebe published “No Longer At Ease,” the second book in his trilogy, 
  set at the brink of Nigeria’s independence and depicting the moral destruction of Igbo society and culture by colonialism.</li>
<li><strong>1961</strong> - Achebe met his wife, Christie Chinwe Okoli in Nigerian Broadcasting Service. 
  The two married on September 10th.</li>
<li><strong>1964</strong> -  he published “Arrow of God,” the third book in the series, 
  set between pacification and independence and portraying the slow death of Igbo culture during colonialism.</li>
<li><strong>1967-1970</strong> - The Nigerian Civil War: Achebe’s Contributions to the war effort of Biafrans: 
  During the Biafran war from 1967 to 1970, Chinua Achebe supported the independence of Biafra and served as an ambassador for the movement.
   He appealed for aid from Europe and the Americas as the Nigerian Civil War devastated the population. 
   After the Nigerian government regained control of the region in 1970, Achebe became involved in political parties. 
   However, he soon grew disillusioned due to his frustration with the ongoing corruption and elitism he observed.</li>
<li><strong>1979</strong> - Achebe was awarded the Nigerian National Merit Award.</li>
<li><strong>1987</strong> - Achebe published his fifth novel, “Anthills of the Savannah,” 
  which tells the story of a military coup in the fictional West African nation of Kangan. 
  The novel was a finalist for the Booker Prize and received critical acclaim. 
  The Financial Times praised it as a “powerful fusion of myth, legend and modern styles” and an “essential” book. 
  Despite this praise, the Booker Prize was awarded to Penelope Lively for her novel “Moon Tiger.”</li>
<li><strong>1990</strong> - After a car accident in Nigeria left him partially paralyzed, 
  Achebe moved to the US and taught at Bard College and later at Brown University.</li>
<li><strong>2000</strong> - Achebe published Home and Exile, a semi-biographical collection of his thoughts on life away from Nigeria.</li>
<li><strong>2007</strong> -  Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement.</li>
<li><strong>2010</strong> - Achebe was awarded The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize for $300,000, one of the richest prizes for the arts.</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong> - Achebe released his final publication during his lifetime, “There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra,” 
  which rekindled the conversation about the Nigerian Civil War. </li>
<li><strong>2013</strong> - On March 21st He died in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. At the age of 82 years. </li>
    </ul>

      whose wisdom and courage are an inspiration to all who knew him,"

    </blockquote>

    <p id="p2">Chinua Achebe’s legacy lives on, in the stories he told, in his love for his culture and people, 
      in his belief in equality and his detest of racism, he stood for truth and justice, and inclusion, 
      Achebe was a feminist as much as he was a masculinist, his legacy lives on in every Nigerian child and beyond, 
      a prove of this is the <strong>Chinua Achebe Literary Festival</strong> 
      which is  an annual literary event held in honour of the Nigerian writer and literary critic, 
      to commemorate and celebrate his works and immense contributions in the literary field.</p>
